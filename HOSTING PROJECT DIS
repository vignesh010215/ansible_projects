EC2 MACHINE:

           "I will dive into EC2, which provides virtual servers in the cloud. I will learn how to launch EC2 instances, connect to them using SSH, 
            and understand key concepts such as instance  types, security groups, and key pairs. I have created five machines, with one master and four slaves, 
            configured using Ansible."
